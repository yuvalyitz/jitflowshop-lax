/-!
A word determines the Multicoloured Clique instance it encodes.

The word is a graph block, a colour per vertex, and the number of colours. None of the
three parts is delimited, so the claim is not immediate: what makes the split unique is
that the graph block declares its own length in its first two entries — three header and
offset entries, one offset per vertex, and two target entries per edge. So the number of
vertices and the number of edges are read off the whole word, the graph block is the
prefix of the length they determine, and everything after it is determined in turn.

Two instances with the same encoding therefore have the same vertices, the same colours,
the same edges and the same colouring, and one has a multicoloured clique exactly when
the other does. So a reduction can choose an instance
for its input word without the choice mattering.
